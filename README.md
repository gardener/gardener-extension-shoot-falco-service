Project Gardener implements the automated management and operation of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters as a service.
Its main principle is to leverage Kubernetes concepts for all of its tasks.

Recently, most of the vendor specific logic has been developed [in-tree](https://github.com/gardener/gardener).
However, the project has grown to a size where it is very hard to extend, maintain, and test.
With [GEP-1](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/proposals/01-extensibility.md) we have proposed how the architecture can be changed in a way to support external controllers that contain their very own vendor specifics. This way, we can keep Gardener core clean and independent.

This extension integrates [Falco](https://falco.org/), the cloud-native runtime security tool, into Gardener shoot clusters. It enables automated deployment, configuration, and lifecycle management of Falco, providing real-time security event detection for container workloads. This functionality of this extension was first proposed in the [GEP-27](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/a0f959ee152e13a22db1b0d9f6f146bc16c8b7ed/docs/proposals/27-falco-extension.md).

## Overview
- **Extension Name:** `gardener-extension-shoot-falco-service`
- **Purpose:** Deploy and manage Falco in shoot clusters via Gardenerâ€™s extension mechanism
- **Features:**
  - Automated Falco deployemnt with lifecycle management
  - Deployment with standard or custom Falco rules
  - Support for custom event storage


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A running Gardener landscape (see Gardener documentation)
- Access to a shoot cluster
- Extension enabled in the landscape configuration via [extension configuration](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-falco-service/blob/main/docs/extension-configuration.md)

### Installation
Add the extension to your shoot manifest:
```yaml
  extensions:
    - type: shoot-falco-service
```

For a full shoot extension section configuration, refer to the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-shoot-falco-service/blob/main/docs/falco-configuration.md)

## How to start using or developing this extension controller locally

You can run the controller locally on your machine by executing `make start`. Please make sure to reference the kubeconfig to the seed you want to connect to via the `KUBECONFIG` variable and the respective gardener via the `GARDEN_KUBECONFIG` variable.
Static code checks and tests can be executed by running `make verify`. We are using Go modules for Golang package dependency management and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo)/[Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega) for testing.
